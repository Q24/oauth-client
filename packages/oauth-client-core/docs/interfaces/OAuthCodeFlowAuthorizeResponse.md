## Properties

### code

• **code**: `string`

The authorization code generated by the authorization server. The
authorization code MUST expire shortly after it is issued to mitigate the
risk of leaks.  A maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
RECOMMENDED. The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once.
If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server
MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens
previously issued based on that authorization code.  The authorization code
is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.
